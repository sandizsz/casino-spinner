    <h2>Introduction to Blackjack</h2>
    <p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino card games in the world. The objective is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cards 2-10 are worth their face value</li>
      <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10</li>
      <li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>The game begins with each player placing their bet. The dealer then deals two cards to each player and two to themselves (one face up, one face down).</p>
    
    <h2>Player Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hit: Take another card</li>
      <li>Stand: Keep your current hand</li>
      <li>Double Down: Double your bet and take one more card</li>
      <li>Split: If you have a pair, split them into two separate hands</li>
