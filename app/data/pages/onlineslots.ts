        <h2>Early History</h2>
        <p>Though online slots came into existence in the 1990s after the increasing use of the internet, slot machines have a long history. The first slot machine was introduced by Charles fey in 1887 which had 5 symbols and 3 reels and an automatic payment system. After the name of one of its symbols it was known as Liberty Bell.</p>
        
        <p>One more slot machine was invented simultaneously but it paid in terms of gums and sweets instead of money as instead of cards it used fruit symbols for the purpose of its promotion. These machines found in various pubs of the UK were known as Fruit Machines.</p>

        <h2>Types of Online Slots</h2>
        <p>Normally three types of slot games are played online.</p>
  
        <h3>Video Slots</h3>
        <p>It is known for its 5 reels and 1-100 pay lines. Though the basics of playing video slots are the same as that of other online slots, it still offers a wide variety for the players to choose. Today their storyline and characters are based on movies and superheroes to make them more interesting.</p>
  
        <h3>Mega Spin Slots</h3>
        <p>It is another unique online slot machine which allows you to play on 3 â€“ 9 slot machines at a time. You will have to decide the number of slots and the number of coins you want to play with before pressing its spin button. All the slots will spin simultaneously. You can win big money easily as 45 reels will be spinning side-by-side.</p>
  
        <h3>Progressive Slots</h3>
        <p>The network of these slot machines shares a jackpot which grows every time when someone plays one of its games until he wins the jackpot. The number of people playing this game at a time helps in determining the size of the jackpot.</p>
  
        <h2>Strategies for Success</h2>
        <p>Though there is no strategy to play online slots that can ensure your success still people use various strategies along with their luck to win slot games while playing online. Some of the popular strategies are briefly discussed here for your reference.</p>
  
        <h3>The Bankroll Management Strategy</h3>
        <p>According to this strategy you should make up your mind before playing on online slots about the amount of money you want to spend on it. Suppose you want to spend your evening nicely with your $100 by playing online slot games and lose nearly one third of it in the first two spins. It can be a disappointing situation for you. You should check the full betting range of the slot machine and decide your budget before starting to play the game.</p>
  
        <h3>Connect Pay Lines to Costs</h3>
        <p>Players usually use their pay lines for building a winning spin and calculating winning coins but they should also use them while calculating the actual cost of the slot machine. Suppose you play at a slot with 25 pay lines and bet on 5 of them only to win a six-figured jackpot. In this situation you should remember the general rule of playing slots that to win the large jackpot you should bet on all the 25 pay lines even if its cost is more than that of a few bets you spend to win a modest amount. So you should consider your affordability to bet on all the pay lines before starting the game.</p>
  
        <h3>Stop Stalking Players</h3>
        <p>Some people observe other players to find the winning tip for them like people do on actual land casinos. But this strategy usually does not ensure their success as slots normally pay randomly. They may not pay on one tip for hours and can pay big win on two consecutive spins. So instead of stalking others you should try your luck while playing online slot games.</p>
  
        <h3>Maximum Bet Strategy</h3>
        <p>Go for the maximum bet: The results of your two bets can be very different if you bet $2 coin on one bet or four coins of $0.50. The latter will increase your chances to win as it multiplies your winning amount according to the number of coins you have used to bet.</p>
